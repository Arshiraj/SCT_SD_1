This is a simple C++ console-based Temperature Converter program that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user selects the input unit, enters the temperature value, and the program calculates and displays the equivalent temperatures in the other two units. The program uses basic conditional statements and mathematical formulas for the conversions. It is designed for beginners to practice working with user input, arithmetic operations, and output formatting in C++.
